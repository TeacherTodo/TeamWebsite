          <center><h3>Problem Statement</h3></center>
          <p>Our team is working to create a viable product to help manage a student-teacher transition process. 
          It will reduce the amount of time it takes to get students enrolled in teaching jobs outside of college 
          and streamline the application process for faculty. </p>
          
          <p>This process is offered to 12 different degree programs, each with differing requirements that must be managed.
          Currently, the College of Education uses a manual process to track requirements for each individual student 
          teacher in an Excel spreadsheet. College of Education staff spend well over 200 hours each semester on this 
          process that could be used to provide other services to students. </p>
          
          <center><h3>General Solution</h3></center>

          <p>Our goal is to make this process automated, so that no data will need manual input, and students can upload 
          their own data for review by faculty members at their earliest convienence. Simultaneously, faculty will also 
          be able to see student progress, and be able to identify exactly where they are in their current projection 
          plan. An approximated idea of what this would look like is shown below.</p>

          <center><h3>Requirements</h3></center>
          <p>Our requirements include: </p> 
          <p>- A streamlined experience for any students or faculty who are involved in the process. </p>
          <p>- Safe and efficent manangment of data. </p>
          <p>- Maintained privacy for students and faculty throughout our system. </p>
          <p>We have accomplished these requirements by starting 
            with the data manangment systems and moving up to the user interface from there, 
            allowing all of the data to be securly transferred to and from the students or 
            faculty that would be using this system. Creating a backend-based system allows 
            for more changes to be implemented if the requirements for certain courses need 
            to be added, removed or altered. It also allows for more of a streamlined 
            experience through differing programs having a direct connection to their backend 
            counterparts</p>

        <div id="Solution" class="tabcontent">
          <justify>
          <center><h3>Project Solution</h3></center>
          <p>Our current solution is a web application that allows the College of Education
            to track and manage student requirements. This application acts as a single 
            source of truth for a student's progression in the Student Teacher Intern Certificate
            (STIC) program. The web app has two views:
          </p>
          <center><h3>Student Dashboard</h3></center>
          <p>The student dashboard is the page that students will be brought to when they log in to
            the application. It will display their tasks in a list format, and each task will have a 
            due date as well as a task status, either being Incomplete, In Progress, or Completed. 
            A student will be able to access each of their tasks, attach documents to certain tasks,
            and then submit those documents for administrator review. 
          </p>
          <h1 align="center"><img src="Student.png" alt="Student View"></h1>
          <center><h3>Administrator Dashboard</h3></center>
          <p>The administrator dashboard is more complex than the student dashboard. This dashboard 
            displays all students currently enrolled in the STIC program, as well as all of their tasks, 
            task statuses, and any documents that those tasks may need. Of course, this can become 
            overwhelming very quickly, so the administrator dashboard also includes a filtering system 
            to help administrators be able to narrow down particular students, whether it be by name or 
            based on their task status. The administrator dashboard also includes a navigation bar at the 
            top of the page. In this navigation bar, administrators are able to add new majors, requirements, 
            and even new administrators to the STIC program, as well as review any majors, requirements, 
            documents, or administrators currently implemented in the program. Finally, the program allows 
            for student data to be imported or exported using FileMaker Pro or an Excel spreadsheet, 
            which allows for flawless integration with the current system in use by the College of Education.

          <center><h3>Front End</h3></center>
          <h4>HTML-5</h4>
          <p>We used HTML-5 to create and format our two dashboards (Showcased on the 
            Solution tab), both in the trial stages of the project and in the final project itself. 
            We also used HTML-5 to create this website, which helps to elaborate more on the project
            and its different aspects. 
          </p>
          <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
          <p>As a formatting tool, CSS files can really only do so much. We implemented Bootstrap 
            as a more formal and set way to ensure our front end dashboards looked uniform and 
            smooth for the project. It also gave us more tools to implement in the dashboards, such 
            as the expanding accordian tabs that display the tasks for both students and administrators.
          </p>
          <h4>Thymeleaf</h4>
          <p>The implementation of Thymeleaf was used as a way to correctly and quickly draw from 
            Java files and store those variables in the HTML pages, while still maintaining the 
            structure of an HTML webpage. This was used as a way to help implement a connection 
            between the back end Java code and the front end HTML code. 
          </p>
          <h4>JavaScript</h4>
          <p>As many developers know, JavaScript is neccesary to many different parts of any front 
            end programs. It handles the movements and operations of the buttons, tabs, accordians, 
            and many other small things that allow the front end pages to work successfully. While 
            its involvment with the project was minimal, it still adds a lot to our webpage. 
          </p>
          <center><h3>Back End</h3></center>
          <h4>Java</h4>
          <p>Our project's main backend is coded in Java. It is set up and shared between all of 
            the different technologies that we are using. Java is also a language that our team is 
            familiar with, so we have chosen to use that in order to make sure all of us are able 
            to contribute to and understand the project.
          </p>
          <h4>SpringBoot</h4>
          <p>Our team used SpringBoot to be able to have webpage generation for the project. 
            We also used it to store our data endpoints and have a launching point for the web app.
            Spring works as the overall connecting portion of our product, working to connect the 
            web app to the backend database. 
          </p>
          <h4>MySQL</h4>
          <p>We used MySQL to store the data that the web app would need to be able to draw from 
            for both dashboards. The student dashboard uses it to draw in one student's data, using 
            the user ID to find the records of the student's tasks and major. The administrator 
            dashboard uses it to be able to seperate the students, drawing in all of the information 
            and using it to seperate out student tasks by students. 
          </p>
          <h4>Amazon S3</h4>
          <p>Our team chose S3 because we have already had experience with Amazon Web Services in 
            the past. Amazon S3 is used as our document storage, so it can store whatever documents 
            we need and assign it to a specific task ID to be able to be referenced by our web app 
            later. This means that we don't have to take up space by assigning the document to a 
            location in a MySQL document. 
          </p>
          <center><h3>Project Manangment</h3></center>
          <h4>GitHub</h4>
          <p>We decided on using GitHub very early on in the project. It was the easiest way to 
            manage our project and organize it based on the amount of code we would be writing 
            asynchronously. We have our project on GitHub, seperated out into many repositories 
            to keep everything organized and keep it from interacting with each other.
          </p>
          <h4>IntelliJ</h4>
          <p> We found IntelliJ to be the best suited to our project, as it is able to run our 
            project's two servers at the same time. It is also able to connect straight to GitHub, 
            which reduced the need to have multiple tabs open at the same time. Overall, it has been our 
            main IDE for our group for the duration of this project. 
          </p>
          <h4>Microsoft Office</h4>
          <p> Microsoft Office is where all of our deliverables are stored. The online version 
            allows for asynchronous work on documents, and we have all worked with the Office Suite 
            before. It is also secure and not as finicky as Google Drive or GitHub, both of which 
            we attempted to use before we switched over to Microsoft Office.
          </p>
          <h4>Discord</h4>
          <p> We use Discord as our main form of communication. It allows us to tag certain team 
            members as well as communicate through text and calls in one space. It is also been our 
            way of keeping track of due dates in one location, as we use it to schedule when we 
            complete items by and when certain parts of the project need to be finished by.
