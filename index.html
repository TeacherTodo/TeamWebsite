          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Our team is working to create a viable product to help manage a student-teacher transition process. 
          It will reduce the amount of time it takes to get students enrolled in teaching jobs outside of college 
          and streamline the application process for faculty. </p>
          
          <p>This process is offered to 12 different degree programs, each with differing requirements that must be managed.
          Currently, the College of Education uses a manual process to track requirements for each individual student 
          teacher in an Excel spreadsheet. College of Education staff spend well over 200 hours each semester on this 
          process that could be used to provide other services to students. </p>
          
          <p>Our goal is to make this process automated, 
          so that no data will need manual input, and students can upload their own data for review by faculty members 
          at their earliest convienence. Simultaneously, faculty will also be able to see student progress, and be able 
          to identify exactly where they are in their current projection plan.</p>

          

          <p>This project stemmed from our sponsor, Chris Aungst, in the form of this Capstone Project Proposal</p>

        <div id="Requirements" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>Requirements</h3>
          <p>Our requirements include a streamlined experiance with any students 
            or faculty who are involved in the process, safe and efficent manangment of 
            data, and of course maintained privacy for students who decide to pursue this 
            course of action. We believe that we can accomplish these requirements by starting 
            with the data manangment systems and moving up to the user interface from there, 
            allowing all of the data to be securly transferred to and from the students or 
            faculty that would be using this system. Creating a backend based system allows 
            for more changes to be implemented if the requirements for certain courses need 
            to be added, removed or altered. It would also allow for more of a streamlined 
            experiance through differing programs having a direct connection to their backend 
            counterparts</p>
        </div>

        <div id="Solution" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>Ideal Solution</h3>
          <p>Our ideal solution is a web app that will act as a single source of truth for 
            all student information. Storing school records along with auxiliary documents.
            This information will be pulled from existing school records APIs, and student 
            and admin accounts and authentication will be provided through the school 
            authentication system. This would also allow for the ability to send documents 
            for signatures electronically rather than physically.
          </p>
          <h3>Non-Ideal Solution</h3>
          <p>If we do not have access to existing school infrastructure, we still have options.
            The system will continue to offer the same functionality, but will require 
            additional human input. Student records will have to be imported by a college employee 
            and site admin. It will then be parsed by the system to generate student accounts, 
            and accompanying data.
          </p>
          <p>Reguardless of how we are able to accomplish this goal, we will be using an HTML5-based 
            front-end User Interface. The final design of this UI is not set, but below is an example 
            of a very basic student view.</p>

        <div id="Technologies" class="tabcontent">
          <h3>Technologies</h3>
          <p>We are using Java to code the basic backend functions, allowing us to sort and 
            notify the correct users when data is uploaded or updated to a database. We also 
            plan to use OpenAPI for the data modeling and API models. Lastly we are planning 
            to use SprintBoot to generate webpages for users to be able to access or edit their 
            data, as a kind of popup UI for the time being.</p>

            
            <p>We do plan to deploy a cloud infastructure using SQL for the database and implementing 
            an S3-like Solution as large format data storage for files, but right now we are 
            focusing on the basics of the backend solution.</p>
            
            <p>Our schedule is shown in the Gantt Chart below, and we plan to begin full scale development in eary January.</p>
